# Micro-Frontend with React, Bootstrap & TypeScript

This project demonstrates a **Micro-Frontend architecture** using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **TypeScript**.  
The goal is to build modular, scalable, and maintainable applications where independent teams can develop and deploy features without interfering with each other.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Micro-Frontend architecture** – build modular applications
- **React + TypeScript** – for type safety and maintainability
- **Bootstrap 5** – for responsive UI components
- **Independent builds** – each micro-frontend can be developed and deployed separately
- **Integration ready** – compose multiple micro-frontends into a single host app

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Webpack Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) (if used for micro-frontend integration)

## 🔗 Example Micro-Frontend Setup

If using **Webpack Module Federation**, you may configure it like this:

```js
// webpack.config.js (simplified)
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: "app1",
  filename: "remoteEntry.js",
  exposes: {
    "./Button": "./src/components/Button",
  },
  shared: ["react", "react-dom"],
});
```
